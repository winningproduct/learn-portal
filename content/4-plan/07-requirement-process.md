## Why
The main intention of a requirement process is to confirm that the correct requirements are captured. 
The product should ultimately solve customers' needs and thus, investigating and capturing the precise requirement is crucial. In other words, this is about finding out what users are willing to pay. The captured requirements then need to be documented to help with information retention and communication. It also acts as evidence for any further clarification. 

The idea here should be to build a Win-Win strategy with product users. The product team should focus on identifying users' correct problem and not hesitate to pay money to get their problem solved.


## How
The following pointers will help with the requirement process.

- Early customer feedback
Focus on getting feedback from users as early as possible in the development cycle. The idea here is to make sure that the investment of development is spent on features that customers are willing to pay. Using the Lo/High fidelity prototypes that were discussed earlier, focus on getting users to feedback on feature importance and pointers long before even the development starts.

- Customer Involvement
Include customers in the development life cycle. Have specialized people who work with customers and use this input to feature prioritization and ultimately, to define the product road map. It is also important to be transparent about this with customers to think Win-Win.

- Data-driven
The decisions made on the product road map and the feature prioritization needs to be derived from data analysis. Customer requirements need to be scientifically obtained with a large enough data set to decide what features benefit the entire customer base.

- Product road map
The requirement process is the journey of converting users' needs into product requirements. It is important to translate requirements captured earlier into features and finally prioritize them to a product road-map based on potential gains and feasibility. The product road map then needs to be communicated to all stakeholders of the company.
