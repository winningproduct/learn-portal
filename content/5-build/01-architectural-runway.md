## What
Incrementally prepare the architecture to support upcoming features and other requirements. Strike a balance between Big-Up-Front (BUF) and No-Up-Front (NUF). Set up architectural collaboration between the teams as the project gets bigger.

## Why
It is important to understand different architectural approaches for someone to appreciate the need for an architecture runway.

### Big Up Front (BUF)
BUF (also known as BDUP) usually results in over-engineered unrealistic architectures that are not flexible to adapt the incremental knowledge and market dynamics.
No Up Front (NUF)

### No Up Front (NUF)
NUP is realtime, just-in-time architecture practices that can result in costly re-architecting efforts due to lack of planning. Not recommended for products that has long-term RoI expectations.

### Emergent Agile Architecture
The idea of emergent agile architecture is to do just enough, at the “last responsible moment". It should be noted that agile architecture principles recommend only "intentional" architecture, not just-in-time architecture.

### Architecture Runway
Although emergent architecture may work for simple solutions and at the start of the product development when teams grow and the systems get complicated, you need a more structured approach to architecture. All teams should coordinate and agree on the architecture approach and do some level of planning ahead. But at the same time, you need to avoid falling to BUF trap.

Architecture Runway assist you to define how much of planned architecture is needed. Also it creates a process outline to coordinate the architectural efforts. It's the SAFe process who coined the term and lead the thinking around Architecture Runway.

## How
- Usually a product's initial architecture blueprint is laid-off by a single team lead by a system architect. To this infrastructure one or few agile teams add architectural components required by next immediate functional features.
- Depending on the phase of the development, your team should determine the length of the Runway. Such depends on the speed of development, team size, team distribution, etc. As SAFe website points out; ```the bigger the aircraft (system) and the faster the flying speed (velocity), the more runway is needed to land the PI safely.```
- Architecture Runway should be continuously maintained not just during the initial phases of the product development. Measuring velocity, conducting periodic ceremonies are important to carryout a stable velocity and length of Runway.
- Team should take precautions not to have a lengthy Runway (BUF) to overly constrain development work. At the same time, a too short Runway will block the teams from meeting immediate feature goals and results in a lot of architectural rework.
- Changes to the product goal may require building more Runway or to invalidate already built Runways. Therefore changes to the product goals should be continuously assessed to see the potential impacts on architecture.
