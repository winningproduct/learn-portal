metaTitle: "Product Pricing Plan | WP"
metaDescription: "Pricing is one of the four Ps of marketing (product, price, place, promotion) and it is one of the key elements of every B2C strategy. When a business offers a truly unique product or service with little direct competition, it would be challenging to establish the price. Define a strong strategy and competitive analysis so you can view, What your prospects might pay for other solutions to their problems and Where your price should fall in relation to theirs"

## Why
When the price, value proposition and positioning are aligned, the business is in the best situation to maximize revenue and profits.
There are many factors to consider when developing the pricing strategy, both short- and long-term. For example, pricing needs to:

- Reflect the value you provide versus your competitors
- Match what the market will truly pay for your offering
- Support your brand
- Enable you to reach your revenue and market share goals
- Maximize your profits

## How
In the marketing mix, pricing is the only thing that brings revenue and as such, it is vitally important that the business becomes familiar with the ways the business can use it to its advantage. These methods include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Penetration pricing
  - This is a pricing strategy that revolves around pricing a product or service low enough so that it attracts customers and captures market share. Once the product is established in the minds of the consumer, the price can then be raised.
- Pre-emptive pricing
  - Also known as predatory pricing, this strategy is aggressive in nature and is intended to drive away competition or deter others from entering the marketplace by deliberately selling at below market prices (temporarily). Preemptive pricing strategies typically exist in monopolies or other markets characterized by low levels of competition.
- Premium decoy pricing
  - This is a pricing structure that sets prices in conflict with one another internally. In other words, you will be pricing one of your products or services at a higher price to encourage sales of another product, the results of which are surprisingly consistent.
- Premium pricing
  - If you are in possession of a quality product or service, premium pricing represents a way for you to set its value artificially high in an attempt to encourage a favorable public perception, something that you will have on your side as a new startup.
- Psychological pricing
  - This is something that is talked about a lot in behavioral economics. In effect, psychological pricing is something that we as consumers are exposed to every day. This is the reason why you’ll rarely find a product or service priced at irregular values that do not end in a 0, a 5 or a 9, as these are the amounts most customers are willing to buy at.
- Value-based pricing
  - The following pricing strategy is one which really only affects products and speaks to the relative value placed on an object. As such, the perceived value of something is what creates its value. If you can find out how much your customers are willing to spend before the price becomes a deal-breaker, you’ll be well-placed to maximize your profits.
- Price leadership
  - This is the point at which your business becomes self-sufficient and is able to dictate prices within the marketplace. As such, it is an ideal goal to aim for and will work best for businesses operating in industries where competition is scarce.
