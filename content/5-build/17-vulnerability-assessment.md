## Why
Vulnerability assessment is a process of identifying, evaluating, and classifying security vulnerabilities of an application considering corresponding risk values, so it will helps to narrow down to the most threatening ones for timely risk reduction. Conducting a vulnerability assessment is a proactive approach towards application security, providing more insights on what vulnerabilities are more likely to be exploited, so it can be quickly patch the worst flaws before they lead to a breach.

## How
A vulnerability assessment process consists of four steps: identification, analysis, assessment and remediation.

**1. Vulnerability identification (testing)**

The objective of this step is to draft a comprehensive list of an application’s vulnerabilities. Security analysts test the security health of applications, servers or other systems by scanning them with automated tools, or testing and evaluating them manually. Analysts also rely on vulnerability databases, vendor vulnerability announcements, asset management systems and threat intelligence feeds to identify security weaknesses.

**2. Vulnerability analysis**

The objective of this step is to identify the source and root cause of the vulnerabilities identified in step one.

It involves the identification of system components responsible for each vulnerability, and the root cause of the vulnerability. For example, the root cause of a vulnerability could be an old version of an open source library. This provides a clear path for remediation – upgrading the library.

**3. Risk assessment**

The objective of this step is the prioritizing of vulnerabilities. It involves security analysts assigning a rank or severity score to each vulnerability, based on such factors as:

- Which systems are affected.
- What data is at risk.
- Which business functions are at risk.
- Ease of attack or compromise.
- Severity of an attack.
- Potential damage as a result of the vulnerability.

**4. Remediation**

The objective of this step is the closing of security gaps. It’s typically a joint effort by security staff, development and operations teams, who determine the most effective path for remediation or mitigation of each vulnerability.

Specific remediation steps might include:

- Introduction of new security procedures, measures or tools.
- The updating of operational or configuration changes.
- Development and implementation of a vulnerability patch.
