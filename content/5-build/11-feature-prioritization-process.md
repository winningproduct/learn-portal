## Why
If we do not select proper features in the planning stage, which need to be in the end product, it takes forever to deliver even an MVP(Minimum Viable Product). And sometimes, valuable time of teams are wasted developing features that no one needs. This can be catastrophic for businesses with limited time and budget, and especially for startups

## How
Feature prioritization starts with a shared vision and purpose. There are some incredibly smart and easy strategies for diving deep into product decisions and help you prioritize features, improvements, and ideas.

- Place features into themes to avoid choice paralysis
  - Before you dive right into prioritizing individual features, you need to break them up into smaller groups. Choice paralysis is a real issue when it comes to picking projects to work on. And one of the easiest ways to avoid it is to use feature “themes”.
- Break down product features by feasibility, desirability, and viability
  - If personal biases and recency can lead us astray, then one of the first things you want to do is to look at your features through a more objective lens. Namely, that means looking at each one based on a few criteria and talking to specific members of your team
    - Feasibility
    - Desirability
    - Viability
- Score options on an Effort/Impact scale
  - With your features more or less mapped out and validated, it’s time to look at which ones are most important to work on first. A basic and commonly used way to do this is to plot them on a simple Effort/Impact matrix.
- Go deeper with the RICE Method
  - Sometimes features are complicated and need to be prioritized with more detail than a simple grid can do. In this case, the RICE method is a great way to score priorities.
    - Reach
    - Impact
    - Confidence
    - Effort
- Use a Priority Scorecard to score features by custom criteria
- Use the Kano Method to prioritize features by delight
- Prioritize features by constraints
