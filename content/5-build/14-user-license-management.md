## Why
A license establishes the legal right for the customer to use a product or service. In cloud-based SAAS applications, a license is usually subscription-based and helps companies to collect revenue from customers methodically.

## How
All software has a license attached, whether the program is a simple freeware tool, whether the program is a simple freeware tool, or an expensive enterprise suite. Following are different types of licenses:
- **Per device:** Strictly meant to be used on a single machine.
- **Per user:** Restricted to one specific user who has to log in or otherwise confirm their identity for the license to be valid.
- **Subscription:** Can refer to both user and device licenses and is managed by a subscription that usually has an expiry date.
- **Cloud-based credits subscription:** A sub-type of subscription hosted in the cloud.
- **General public license (GPL):** Covers freeware and means the license and software come with no charge, and can be used, shared, copied, and modified for free.
- **Client access license (CAL):** Refers to both device and user metrics and means that users can connect to a particular server and access software installed there.
- **Capacity-based license:** Tied to certain configuration metrics, such as for a CPU, and is based on the capacity of the CPU, hard drive, or other hardware configuration elements.
- **Freeware:** Free to use, but the creator holds the copyright.
