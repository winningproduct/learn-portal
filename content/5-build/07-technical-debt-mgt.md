## Why
Technical debt is a form of accumulated bugs or technical shortcuts used during development. Technical debt should be managed during the product life cycle. However, it doesn't mean there should be zero technical debt. It’s more about managing product code deficiencies in a more effective manner that adds value to the business & product.

## How
When dealing with technical debt, feature development time, delivery deadlines, business impact, and development cost has to be considered to find a suitable strategy to manage technical debt. The following are some of those strategies. Once the project team agrees upon a plan, they must adhere.

- 1 Out of every 4 work items
- 1 Day a week
- Rotating role
- Refactoring as part of feature work
