## Why
Data and customers are vital assets to a company.  Data collected from customers must be handled carefully with transparency and adhering to privacy policies, thereby building trust and accountability with your customers.

## How
The following are some guidelines to protect private information.

- Integrate training on data privacy into the general training program to prevent social engineering attacks
- Implement a zero-trust model by restricting access to the entire network and whitelisting only the essential entities
- Production, development and testing environments must be segregated, and tight security must be enforced on the production environment
- Follow the guidelines of regulations like GDPR, CCPA. I.e., Signing contracts with data processors, Encrypt data at rest and transit, Regular audits, etc
- Implement IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
