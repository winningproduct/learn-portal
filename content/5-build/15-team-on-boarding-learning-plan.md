## Why
An effective team on-boarding and learning process allows a new employee to quickly acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors required to effectively adapt to their job role within the company. It reduces new employee ramp-up time and helps them adapt to the company culture quickly.

## How
Team on-boarding and learning process doesn’t begin and end on a new employee’s first couple of days at work. It begins when you initiate the hiring process and ends when the new employee is fully settled into their role.

An employee on-boarding checklist should be maintained to track the following on-boarding process(in order to stay compliant):

- During the hiring process:
  - Be cautious on the Halo Effect (Try to give a positive first impression).
  - Make sure the candidate's experience is welcome (Start interview on time, don't cancel interviews at the last moment, offer candidates some water or coffee, etc.).
  - Proper communication throughout the hiring process and the interview setup (inform interview schedules in advance, explain the interview process and what to expect etc.).
  - Provide a clear job description that gives the new employee a concrete list of responsibilities.
  - Ensure the employee contract is clear and concise (without ambiguity). Also make sure you give them enough time to go through it.


- After hiring but before the new employee's first day:
  - Prepare new employee workstation and necessary accounts.
  - Set up the new employee’s on-line accounts (company email etc.).
  - Set up necessary IT equipment for the new employee (laptop etc.).
  - Arrange for a new employee Id and other passes that’s required.


- First day of the new employee:
  - Make the new employee feel welcome.
  - Provide a welcome package for the new employee including useful items.
  - Lead the new employee on an office tour.
  - Provide access to necessary technical materials.
  - Conduct mandatory onboarding meetings for the new employee.
  - Conduct a formal team onboarding meeting.
  

- During your new employee’s first x months:
  - Arrange knowledge transfer sessions.
  - Identify training needs for the new employee to effectively perform the job and arrange them.
  - Evaluate the new employee’s learning by continuous evaluation.
