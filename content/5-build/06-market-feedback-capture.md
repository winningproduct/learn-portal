## Why

Market feedback is the experience of the users. It exposes the problems and expectations of the users that need to be addressed to provide a good user experience. Market feedback is also a good indicator of customer satisfaction and helps predict business performance in the future (e.g. Net Promoter Score).

## How

- **Direct feedback:** Customers provide the feedback directly via a survey, market research, written complaint, formal letter, or a forum/panel.
  - **Surveys:** Surveys are easy to set up, easy to send out, easy to analyze, and scale very well. We can either use a survey tool (e.g., SurveyMonkey) or incorporate it into our product.
  - Feedback boxes
  - **Direct meetings/calls:** Sometimes, having a one-to-one discussion is the best way to uncover many opinions.

- **Indirect feedback:**
  - A customer speaks about the product without the intention of giving feedback to the business. E.g. The feed from social media sites, review sites, customer care interactions conducted via phone, chat sessions, or email.
   - Website reviews
   - Social media
   - Community forums

- **Inferred feedback:** Derived feedback from transactional, behavioral, and operational data associated with the customer experience. E.g., website clickstream data, purchase history, or contact center data.
