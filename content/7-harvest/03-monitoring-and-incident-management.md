Exceptions and incidents can occur in any software product but having the right monitoring and management process enables to minimize the negative impact of such incidents.

- Understand the SLA requirements.
- Cover areas of SLA and have loggers in place within components and subsystems.
- Have a monitoring tool to detect issues by analyzing the logs, prioritize, and diagnose.
- Have an incident reporting tool to manage the issue backlog.
