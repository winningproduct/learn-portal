## Why

To initiate a new business or operate an existing business it is important to understand the complete picture including the market offering and internal workings of the business. This understanding will enable employees to fine-tune the offerings to maximize corporate goals such as profitability. If you are at startup stage, this understanding is important to evaluate the viability of the business idea.

Every business operates with nemours touch-points with multiple stakeholders which makes it very hard to comprehend in one glance. The [business model canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) serves as a simple understandable format that summarizes how the business is planning to achieve its goals by offering services and products. It also serves as a base document to explain how the company plans to make revenue/profit/company-value thus attracting employees, partners and investors. In a nutshell, the business model canvas is an one paged document synthesizing the business.

## How

Building a business model canvas follows a procedure of filling in each cell in the canvas in predefined order as mentioned below. Content in each cell must answer some important questions as explained below.

### Value Proposition:

Why your customers buy the product? What pain are you solving and what gain are you creating? What is unique about you that makes you stand out in the competition? List your important features, products or services.

### Customer Segments:

Who are your customers? What are the geographic, social characteristics and demographics? List down the persona of all of your customers.

### Channels:

How do you get your product or service available to customers. In the product development context, channels could be a web application, mobile app, etc.

### Customer Relationships:

How do you GET, KEEP and GROW customers. This differs based on the channel adopted and level of engagement required.

### Revenue Stream:

How do you make money by selling your services or products to your customer segments. What strategy/revenue model is adopted to make money.

Once the right side of the canvas is defined, it will give answers to what the company plans to produce, how it plans to deliver and to whom. This half is the outward-facing side of the business which focuses on the customer needs and explains how the revenue streams are created. Now is the time to elaborate the internal workings of the company to produce the expected outcomes.

### Key Resources:

What key assets and resources are required to run the business? From a software product perspective, some of the key resources could be people, intellectual property rights, platforms, etc.

### Key Partners:

Whom do we need to collaborate with outside the organization to help us operate the business?

### Key Activities:

What are the most important things need to do to make the business model work and generate value?

### Cost Structure:

What are the primary costs and expenses to operate the business.

Now the left side of the business model is defined. The left section is inward-facing and focusses on how the company plans to create products or services and who are the key resources and partners. This will explain and visualize the required internal working of a business.
