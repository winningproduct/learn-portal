checklist: 
  -
    order: 1
    question: What is the price of the product and how does it compare against the competition?
    expectation: The team should have clearly identified the selling price and the operational cost component which goes into each item. The profit component should be identified. The price needs to be compared against the competition to assess the market viability of the product.

    order: 2
    question: Do you have strategy in place to keep a steady cash flow throughout the product life cycle?
    expectation: The team should have identified the total cost required before the product makes any revenue and there should be sufficient investment to support that. Thereafter, the team should have identified the cost at each stage and strategies to stay cash flow positive throughout.

    question: Is it operational feasible to keep the business a float? 
    expectation: The team should have identified the operational challenges such as delivery, production, etc.. There should be strategies in place to overcome those challenges.

    question: Is your product or architecture technically feasible to implement?
    expectation: There should be evidence to prove that the team has identified the key quality attributes properly and their celling constraints. Team should have tested the architecture for those corner cases.

## Why

Once you have a clear understanding of the proposed solution, it’s time to do an assessment of your product's feasibility of winning in the market. Don’t do this too early in the process, as it can limit your exploration and thinking. But you should not do this too late as well, to avoid wasting time and money in trying to build something that is not feasible.

## How

As per [lean startup principles](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), the critical questions to answer in evaluating product feasibility are:

- Should this product be built?
  - Does the identified problem exist?
  - Can the solution solve the problem effectively?
- Can we build a sustainable business around this?
  - Will users pay 'enough' to solve this problem?
  - Will they buy the product from us?
- Can this product be built?
  - Technical feasibility
  - Resource availability

### Financial Feasibility

Create a budget for the next X years of operation. Start with expected income and the investments available. List your engineering and operational costs to derive an income statement and a cashflow analysis. Calculate if the project can give the expected ROI. Clearly outline the critical success factors such as sales targets, etc.

### Operational Feasibility

Some business models may require substantial operations on the ground, for example, to onboard users, manage delivery, etc. You should validate the availability of knowledge, competency and resources to carry out the required ground operations.

### Market Feasibility

Calculate the market size and potential share you may capture with your product. Filling an existing market gap through a unique offering is the key to success. Analyze the competitors in the market to evaluate if you have a clear edge and a plan to capitalize on the void in the market. Also consider the growth and stability of the market for a new business to get established.

### Technical Feasibility

Finally, you should evaluate if the proposed solution is technically feasible. There are several aspects to consider:

- Are the selected technologies mature/stable to deliver the functionalies?
- Are your users capable and do they have the necessary resources to use the solution offering?
- Do you have access to required data and integrations?
- Are you able to acquire the necessary regulatory permissions?
