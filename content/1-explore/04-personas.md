## Why

The unique value of a product is represented in features when its mapped to the specific needs of each type of product user. If the product cannot relate and add value to a user's needs, it cannnot offer a unique value proposition to differentiate itself in the marketplace. Using personas, you can explain the feature usage to stakeholders in a meaningful way.
