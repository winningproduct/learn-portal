## Software product market
Yearly, a large number of global ISVs (Independent Software vendors) and Startups are investing on digital services and products to be provided to their customer segments. According to a [researchandmakrkets.com report](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4852466/software-as-a-service-saas-global-market-report) the market size for SaaS based software products alone is valued at about $134.44 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to $220.21 billion at a CAGR of 13.1% through 2022.

## Still the failure rate is high
Despite the lucrative market trend, a majority of Software Products released to the market fail to reach the full potential due to fundamental issues in the product management and engineering approach. 

Creating a market winning (leading) product requires a mammoth of additional knowledge and skills compared to mere software development. Product engineers require a broader sense of the domain, market trends, product management techniques, customer engagement ability, resilient engineering capabilities. Most of such skills are not taught at universities nor gained by engaging general software development work.
