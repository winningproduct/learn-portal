## Software Product Market

Yearly, many ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) and Startups are investing in digital services and products to develop and sustain their business. According to a [researchandmarkets.com](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4852466/software-as-a-service-saas-global-market-report), the market size for SaaS (Software as a Service) alone worth $134.44 billion in 2018. This market expects to grow at a CAGR of 13.1% and reach $220.21 billion through 2022.

## Despite the Growth, Why Some Products Fail?

Despite the lucrative market trend, many Software Products fail to reach full potential due to fundamental issues in product management and engineering.

Creating a market winning (leading) product requires a mammoth of additional knowledge and skills beyond typical software development. Product engineers need a broader sense of the domain, market trends, product management techniques, customer engagement ability, resilient engineering capabilities. Most of such skills are not taught at universities nor gained by engaging general software development work.
