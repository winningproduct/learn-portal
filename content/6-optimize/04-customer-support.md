## Why
`A satisfied customer is one who will continue to buy from you, seldom shop around, refer other customers and in general be a superstar advocate for your business.` - _Gregory Ciotti_

This strategic activity is to organize customer support activities and get correct tools in-place to ensure a fast response to customer requests. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product.

## How
- Define what it means by 'great customer service' and align with your brand values. Set the standards such as:
  - Response time
  - Proactive engagement (e.g. through error detection and fix)
  - Conversational personality
  - How the disagreements/complaints are handled
  - Legal requirements of your agreements and the industry
- •	Determine the channels through which you support the customers. This could vary with the licensing agreement with the customer:
  - Inbound channels (calls, chats, email, SM, Forums, etc)
  - Channels for investigations (Remote desktop, Onsite visits, Event logs, etc.)
- Setup automated help assistants and knowledge bases to reduce your operational costs and provide efficient responses by handling regular queries automatically. This includes an automated self-support process, freeing users from self-help diagnostics, and troubleshooting from online knowledge bases.
- Hire and train your customer support staff who has a customer-centric-mindset. Establish standard response procedures to have consistency across all staff. Train and set KPIs based on customer satisfaction and feedback.
- Setup the right tools and integration in between. The tools can be:
  - Call center software
  - CRM
  - Help Desk ticketing system
  - Social media monitoring
  - Remote assistance tools
  - Event log monitoring
- Most of the traditional tools can be expensive, consider setting up a lean infrastructure as appropriate.
- Establish on-site support procedures if necessary.
