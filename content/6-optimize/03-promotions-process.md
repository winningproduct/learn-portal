## Why
A promotional plan covers all types of communication between the vendor and the target market audience of potential or existing clients. There are four basic components of a promotion plan:
- Advertising
- Personal selling
- Sales promotion
- Public relations

A promotional plan is an integral part of executing product marketing strategies and ensuring the sales targets for a given time (e.g. for a year).

## How
- Before you begin the planning process, decide on the promotional budget.
- Identify the correct promotional mix. When you put together your promotional plan, you need to focus on the right blend of advertising, sales promotion, public relations, and personal selling.
- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various types of promotional techniques. Figure out what works for the product’s target market.
- Decide what response strategies (e.g. for customer leads) should be in place as part of the overall promotional process.
- Plan social media campaigns. Social media promotions are an easy way of connecting with customers, bringing in more fans for your social media platforms, and making conversions.
