## Why
Brand guidelines dictate the content of a logo, blog, website, advertisement, and similar marketing collateral. It ensures that there’s consistency across all branding collateral published by the company. There’s no confusion to the target audience it’s reaching as it distinguishes the brand image strongly from the competition.


## How
Discuss with all stakeholders and identify how you want to portray your brand to the target audience. The following sections are common inclusions in a brand guide manual.
- Logo
- Logo Usage
- Banding Colors
- Image Usage
- Patterns
- Typography

- etc...

Also consider the following:
- Look at the primary value of the product and ensure that you convey that in your message.
- Identify the unique message you want to tell your customers. It needs to be clear and concise.
- Understand the target demographics and optimize your message to fit the target audiences.
