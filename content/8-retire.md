Regardless of how well the product is built and maintained, there is always a retirement time for products. Retirement can be called upon by a major technology or user behavior change in the market place. Such may require you to re-invent the technology platform / business model / user experience to keep an edge in the market. ISVs should be watchful to identify this need so that they are able to disrupt their own business model before a competitor does. 

When a next gen product is planned it is important to do it with minimal disturbance to the existing customers. There has to be clear and pain-free migration paths available and provide incentives/motivation for them to move-on. Long-term side-by-side operation of 2 major versions can be extremely costly operation. For this reason, you must plan to complete migrating all your customers within a planned time span.
