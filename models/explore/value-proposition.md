##What is Value Proposition?



Let's think of a product's USP (Unique Selling Points). Why do companies come up with this? Why is it necessary to define this?



Simple because, in a crowded market, customers get overwhelmed with so many reasons why they should buy a certain product or a service. In order to make this less complicated and more simple, so that the customer can link their needs/wants to what is offered in a product or service, organizations define the most unique selling points.



These unique selling points are derived from a product/service value proposition.

##How

The Value Proposition ensure that a product or service is positioned around what the customer values and needs.

In other words, an organization look at key problems of their customers and link it to key features of their product/service that will resolve those problems.

**Value proposition,**

What value do we deliver to the customer?

Which one of our customer’s problem are we helping to solve?

What bundles of products and services are we offering to each customer segment?

Which customer needs are we satisfying?

**Customer segments** 

For whom are we creating values?

Who are our most important customers?
