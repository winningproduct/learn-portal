##How?

There are different established approaches to carry out competitor analysis in the industry. One standard method is to define a set of indicators such as company highlights, market information, product information, and SWOTT information and measure them for all the competitors. This information is further classified in the following example template.

Details of the factors defined in the template are as follows.

This section provides a general profile of the company in question and might include information such as when the company was formed, how many employees it has etc.
#Key Competitive Advantage: 
This section highlights the key competitive advantage that the profits of this company are based upon. This is often the last section of the competitive analysis template you complete after all other sections are complete.
#Target Market: 
The group of consumers (for B2C) or companies (for B2B) that the company's product is aimed at.
#Market Share: 
the proportion of the market (defined as a percentage) controlled by the company.
#Marketing Strategy: 
The methods the company uses to promote and sell its products and services.
#Products & Services: 
Lists the products and services that the company offers.
#Pricing: 
Lists the pricing of the company's key products and services.
#Distribution Channels:
How the business sells its products and services to customers. This could be either directly to the customer or through a chain of intermediaries e.g., wholesalers, retailers, affiliates, etc.
#Strengths:
Lists the internal capabilities or resources that are a key strength of the business.
#Weaknesses: 
Lists the internal capabilities or resources that are a weakness of the business.
#Opportunities: 
Lists the external factors the business might choose to capitalize on and use to its advantage.
#Threats: 
Lists the external factors which might pose a threat to the business or one of its product or service lines.
#Trends: 
A traditional SWOT analysis alone can be somewhat myopic in nature, causing a company to fix or improve its internal processes. For this reason, a Trends section is included, forcing a company to consider wider trends such as technology trends that may disrupt the business, for example, self-driving cars are a huge non-immediate threat to car insurance businesses.


Overall competitor analysis is initiated "Immerse" stage of the WPO canvas targeting direct and indirect competitors. This will continue in the remaining stages as well to strategically steer the product direction learning from the competition.
