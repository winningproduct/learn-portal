##What
Commercial viability could be defined as the ability of a business, product or service to compete effectively with its competitors and make profit. This is an assessment of the commercial practicality of the proposed idea/product. The key question this activity answer is 'Is it VIABLE to get intended Return on Investment (ROI)?'.



##Why
When you have a business idea, product or service you would to deliver to the market. The first thing to think about is that would this idea sell and make money? Would it be able to compete and survive against its competitors or will it wilt and die off easily. If in separate terms, commercial would be defined as the ability to make profit while viable would mean the ability to survive. Combining both the words would be survivability of a business/product/service.



##How
There’s a few requisites needed to answer the question and determine the level of commercially viable of a product or services. After fulfilling the requirements, then only can the product or service be categorized as commercially viable.



**The requirements are:**

1. Product – How does it solve customer’s problem? What unique characteristic does it have?

2. Market – What is the size and profile of the market, and why customers will buy the idea?

3. Development – Will it work. Can it be made and have you identified a manufacturer? Practicality of a product.

4. Resources – Do you have the skills, time and money to bring your ideas to market?

5. Financials – Will your sales exceed your expenses? Have you prepared cash flow projections.
