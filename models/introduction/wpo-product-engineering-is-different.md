Software product engineering refers to the lifecycle management process of a resalable software asset of an Independent Software Vendor (ISV). It is important to recognize that software product engineering is a specialty and significantly differs from enterprise or bespoke applications that are custom made for a particular organization.



## Architectural Style

Unlike enterprise applications, products require to adapt to the ever changing market conditions to stay ahead of the market. Such emerging changes are often costly in development, and impact not only one organization but a large number of customer organizations using the product. Therefore the agility even at the architecture level is paramount important for winning products. Such agility is gained by thoughtful system decoupling and continuous process practices that are discussed in the Winning Product Canvas.



## Functional Flexibility

Products are not used by a single organization but are sold to multiple client organizations. Business rules, user workflows and third-party integration requirements may substantially differ from one organization to another. Assumptions developers can take are limited and therefore the product must cater a broader configurability and compatibility. For example, the underline domain model needs to be generic and flexible to accommodate workflow differences in organizations. As another example, the product may require a flexible integration layer that can support multiple protocols to suite the different scenarios of different customer organizations.



## Sales and Marketing

An important aspect of a product is to have a unique selling point (USP) against the competition. The success of a product heavily depends on the sales and marketing efforts behind it. It is important that your product is easily accessible by potential customers through seamless capabilities such as self-signup, trials, video documentary, online payments.etc. This is not possible via isolated efforts of sales/marketing personal, but the product has to be engineered to support such functionality in a frictionless manner.



In addition, a good product provides different product variations (editions) to address distinctive market segments. Such editions may be formed with a mix-n-match of features through a license based control mechanism. The features such as ability to trace billing, throttling based on usage, etc. makes product development a speciality over software development.



## User Experience

It should also be noted that the importance of ‘user experience’ is far more prominent in product engineering for two reasons. Firstly, the obvious market competition factor. Secondly for the fact that products are not made for a particular known organizational user base but should cater diverse and unknown user groups of multiple customer organizations. This is a nontrivial challenge that require heavy research and tuning of user journeys. Treating the requirements as mere assumptions to deploy technology based continuous observations/validations is necessary to overcome this challenge.



## Branding and Identity

Often in product offerings, branding cannot be made fixed. Different customers should be able to brand the product according to the theme of their corporate. Customizations and configurations including logos, colors, etc. has to be available to the power users of the customer organization.

To make things further complicated, in certain business models, the product may get sold/distributed through partner channels. Such arrangement makes the ISV an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) where the product should have capabilities of white-labelling.



## Term of ROI

As it take time to find a place in the market, products take longer time to return business benefits. In contrast, RoI is usually immediate as in a custom deployed application at an organization. A product can take considerable time (often years) to harvest the return and therefore until such time the product must stay trendy in the market. Higher degree of maintainability with a lower cost is essential and such requires the use of sophisticates engineering practices such as build/test automation, continuous integration/delivery, strict quality controls, automated continuous releases, etc.
