description: "
Let's think of a product's USP (Unique Selling Points). Why do companies come up with this? Why is it necessary to define this?
 
Simple because, in a crowded market, customers get overwhelmed with so many reasons why they should buy a certain product or a service. In order to make this less complicated and more simple, so that the customer can link their needs/wants to what is offered in a product or service, organizations define the most unique selling points. These unique selling points are derived from a product/service value proposition.

##Why

In a business, a value proposition refers to the value a company promises to deliver to customers. Meaning the customers should choose to buy their product or service. A value proposition can be also be a brand name which a company has build-up and if so this can be a statement that introduces a company's brand to consumers by telling them what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves their business.
A value proposition can be presented as a business or marketing statement that a company uses to summarize why a consumer should buy a product or use a service.

This statement, if worded compellingly, convinces a potential consumer that one particular product or service the company offers will add more value or better solve a problem for them than other similar offerings will.

##How

- The Value Proposition ensure that a product or service is positioned around what the customer values and needs.
- In other words, an organization look at key problems of their customers and link it to key features of their product/service that will resolve those problems.

  - What value do we deliver to the customer?
