## What
A brand for an organization is analogous to a child and a parent. Similar to what a parent feeds the child, teaches the child, what core values are influenced on the child and etc would at the end of the day define how the child is perceived by the community. Similarly creating an identity which enables the stakeholders of an organization to perceive the entity in a given way is considered as a Brand story development. Therefore at the core of Brand story development is sharing “Why” or “The purpose” of the entity to exist. As a result of successful Brand Story Development, the stakeholders could feel at an emotional level what the entity represents, for instance, Apple - “To Think Different”, Volkswagen - “Safety”, Facebook - “Connecting people” and so on.


## Why
“People don't buy What you do; they buy Why you do it. And What you do simply proves what you Believe.” - By Simon Sinek. According to his “Golden Circle” principle by Simon Sinek, gives guidance on how to logically explain a product or a service to the customer which highly incorporates the neurological decision making aspects. Therefore it is very important that when designing a brand story the approach triggers the limbic brain which is in control of the emotional (empathy) aspect of decision making. For instance when a decision maker is given two options to take which has identical physical properties, the decision goes towards the one which triggers the emotional aspect (Gut feeling/ by intuition). Therefore designing a brand story which adheres to such factors could make promising results.

On the other hand, as Steve Jobs mentioned “Marketing is about values. It’s a complicated and noisy world, and we’re not going to get a chance to get people to remember much about us. No company is. So we have to be really clear about what we want them to know about us.”



## How
**“Start with a Why”**
According to the “Golden Circle principle” there are 3 components as follows :

- **Why** : Is how you explain your purpose and the reason you exist and behave as you do.
- **How** : How do to do things.
- **What** : What sort of things to do.

The following image elaborates further on the “Golden Circle” concept and it is highly recommended to follow the video which the concept is conducted by the author himself.
